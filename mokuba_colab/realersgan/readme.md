# How to use py-real-ersgan
If you install py-real-esrgan by the next command, you can't use that module because of Error messages.  
```
pip install realesrgan
```
According to the install guide of [their homepage](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN/tree/master), it is usable without a problem. But it's not very simple.  
After executing the above command, you download setup.py from this directory and run it. Then you can use that module.
